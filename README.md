This code is for Java 6: create and initialize lists, sets and maps in one line!

Single `.java` file, just copy-paste it into your project and write a little bit more laconic test code!

Look at [Builders](https://github.com/flaz14/litenew/blob/master/litenew/src/main/java/com/github/flaz14/litenew/Builders.java) class.
