Java is very verbose. There are plenty of libraries (for example, Guava) which help you to write laconic code. And there
are many cool features in Java 8. So there is nothing new here: just another little wheel for **Java 5** that helps you
to create and initialize lists, sets and maps in one line.

Look at
[Builders](main/litenew/Builders.java)
class. May be that code will save you some amount of hassle...
