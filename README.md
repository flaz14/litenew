Java is very verbose. There are plenty of libraries (for example, Guava) which help you to write laconic code. And there
are many cool features in Java 8. So there is nothing new here: just another re-invented little wheel for **Java 5**
that helps you to create and initialize lists, sets and maps in one line.

Actually, this project is a piece of bullshit. But look at
[Builders](https://github.com/flaz14/litenew/blob/master/main/litenew/Builders.java) class. May be that code will save 
you some amount of hassle...
